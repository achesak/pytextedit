pytextedit is a simple text editor written in Python with Tk for the GUI.

pytextedit requires the Python interpreter and Tk to run. To start, type "python pytextedit.py" into a terminal or command prompt. If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, use the "python3" command instead. Additionally, files can be opened directly from the command line: "python pytextedit.py [filename]". Windows users also double-click "pytextedit.py" to run the application.
