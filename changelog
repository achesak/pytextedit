CHANGELOG

----

0.1alpha1 -> 0.1alpha2

* Redesigned the settings interface. They now show in their own windows.
* Inverted color defaults for the file label.
* Changed file label to have normal relief.
* Fixed Unicode testing. Now explicitly tests for None. Otherwise successfully opening an empty file would test as False, and it would register as a failure. Oops.
* Added "Tools -> Indent All" and "Tools -> Unindent All".
* Fixed a bug that resulted in selected text not being deleting when the enter key is pressed.
* Added more commands to "Search -> Search Selected": DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Bing, Wikipedia, Youtube, Wolfram|Alpha, About.com, Is.gd Shorten, and Is.gd Lookup.
* Added "Tools -> Insert" submenu, with commands to insert line number, character position, filename, directory, and full path.
* Now runs on both python2 and python3, albeit with some features disabled in python2.
* Added an internal file browser.
* Made "Open from URL" work with python2.

----

0.1alpha2 -> 0.1alpha3

* Fixed the bug where clicking on "Cancel" in the Open and Save(As) dialogs would result in an error.

* Added code to check when "Cancel" is pressed or the empty string is entered in dialog, and "return" if one of those conditions is true.
* Added improved "Exit" dialog with "Save" option.
* Removed the "auto-replace" feature. It was useless anyway.
* Changed "Open From URL" so that it doesn't remember the file name (this caused problems with saving later).

----
